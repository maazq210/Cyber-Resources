# Cyber-Resources
A compilation of resources for getting started in cybersecurity

With cybersecurity becoming the hottest job market in recent years, I felt the need to create a resource for anyone interested in getting started in the field. This is not a curriculum or how-to guide perse, but instead a compendium for all the great tutorials, videos, and blogs I've used and learnt from since I started my journey. Feel free to share with anyone you know who would like to get started in cyber. If you find additional resources or would like to request specific information feel free to submit a pull request. 

If you would like to reach out to me personally my email is maazq210@gmail.com
